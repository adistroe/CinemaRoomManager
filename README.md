### About
This is the ***Cinema Room Manager*** project I made myself while studying at [JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org)
<p>Cinema has been a part of the entertainment industry for a long time: a good movie is a way to escape reality and live through a variety of emotions. The best cinema experience you can get is probably in a cinema theatre.</p>
<p>In this project, you will create an application that helps manage a cinema theatre: sell tickets, check available seats, see sales statistics, and more.</p>
This project is a part of the following tracks:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://hyperskill.org/tracks/18">Kotlin Core</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://hyperskill.org/tracks/3">Kotlin Developer</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://hyperskill.org/tracks/16">Android Development with Kotlin</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://hyperskill.org/tracks/37">Kotlin Backend Developer (Spring Boot)</a></li>
</ul>

### Learning outcomes
<p>This project is a good opportunity to work with input and output in Kotlin. You will deal with lists and functions as well as loops and conditional statements.</p>
