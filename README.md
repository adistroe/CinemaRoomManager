### About
This is the ***Cinema Room Manager*** project I made myself while studying at [JetBrains Academy](https://hyperskill.org)
<p>In this project, you will create an application that helps manage a cinema theatre: sell tickets, check available seats, see sales statistics, and more.</p>
This project is a part of the following tracks:
<ul>
